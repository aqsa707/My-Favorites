      Although many people prefer fruits or vegetables for tasting sweeter,
      comparable to candies, I will always choose vegetables over fruits because
      of the ripeness of the fruits. Either, its too sour or tasteless. Never
      in-between.

      I was expecting my schedual to be cramped in my junior year, mostly
      occupied with assingments from my core subjects. With that being said, I
      had to narrow down my hobbies from several to 2 hobbies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Watching Tennis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've been reading Atombic Habits by James Clear.</p>
    <p class="AH">
      "A supremely practical and useful book. James Clear distils the most
      fundamental information about habit formation, so you can accomplish more
      by focusing on less."

      After watching the US Open, I emphazie with the players, emphazing how
      much effort is put into their game playing as solos. All I can do right
      now, with a cramped schedual, is to watch tennis and learn the rules and
      techniques it takes to become a qualifier for this sport.

    <h3>Favorite Thing I can not Live Without!</h3>

      A body of an Homo sapien is made up of 72% of water. If we have the
      resources, we must preserve it to keep us innovated, informed, and able. I
      noticed an iced coffee epidemic while there's no shortage of clean water
      in the Londonderry Area. Despite water being boring, there are
      alternatives to add flavour to water like in the picture I displayed.
      Suddenly, nobody can spare 5 minutes of their day to make flavoured water
      for almost less than $10.00.
